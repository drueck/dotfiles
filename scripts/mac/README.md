# Setup Scripts

It would be nice if I could just run one script to do all these things,
but for now I'm just going to list the order in which they should be
run, because there are some manual steps required for some of these,
and it's possible some could fail due to differences in OS versions etc.

01. homebrew.sh
02. iterm.sh
03. neovim.sh
04. asdf.sh
05. asdf-ruby.sh, then install a ruby and activate it globally
07. asdf-nodejs.sh, then install a nodejs and activate it globally
08. yarn.sh
09. ag.sh
10. rake install
